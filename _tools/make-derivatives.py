"""Rebuild the two derivative image sets from assets/img.

GitHub Pages builds this site server-side with the whitelisted plugins only -
no Actions, no build step - so the small copies cannot be generated at deploy
time. They are generated here and committed with the sources.

    assets/img/640/<stem>.webp    640px-wide copy of anything wider. pic.html
                                  offers it through srcset, so a phone stops
                                  downloading the full desktop file.
    assets/img/thumb/<stem>.webp  copy scaled so its SHORT side is 96px, for
                                  the moderation-gate chips, which render at
                                  34px (index) and 44px (functions) and were
                                  pulling full-resolution photography to do it.

Run it from the repo root after adding, replacing or removing an image:

    python _tools/make-derivatives.py

Sources are never modified. Existing derivatives are overwritten. Every image
wider than 640px gets a 640 copy whether or not a page uses it yet, so adding
a photo to a page can never leave a srcset candidate pointing at nothing.
Needs Pillow: python -m pip install pillow
